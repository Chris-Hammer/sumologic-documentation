This page answers frequently asked questions about Flex pricing.

## What is Flex Pricing?

import FlexPricing from '../../../reuse/flex-pricing.md';

<FlexPricing/>

## Is the Flex pricing available to existing Cloud Flex customers?

No. Flex pricing is the default plan for new customers who sign up with Sumo. Effective May 15, Flex will become available for existing customers, in parallel with the three data tiers (Frequent, Infrequent, and Continuous).

## What is Flex solving?

Log analytics drive thousands of use cases, but the most common solutions Sumo Logic is optimized to support are:

* Troubleshooting and analytics
* Infrastructure monitoring
* Compliance and audit
* Threat detection and investigation

## How is Flex Pricing different from the other data tiers?

With Flex Pricing, there is no cost to ingest and index log data and no requirement to manage storage on your own or rehydrate at a premium for log indexing. This removes the complexity of predetermining the type of analytics required before that data is even in the system. Simply pay for analytics and insights, not data management.
