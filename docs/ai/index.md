Implement machine learning for IT DevSecOps with Sumo Logic

Today's machine learning software applications are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their approach, along with the ways they can be integrated with other functionalities. Machine learning is also frequently seen as a value-added feature for software products across industry verticals, including finance, healthcare and IT. IT security professionals are increasingly relying on machine learning applications to facilitate real-time security monitoring of increasingly large and disparate IT infrastructure networks.

The implementation of machine learning technology to support the security management of cloud services can reduce manual workloads for your team and streamline your incident response process. Sumo Logic uses machine learning and pattern recognition to analyze the millions of log files created by your technology stack, detect anomalies and outlier data, and report security issues in a timely fashion with fewer false positives.

* **Smart alerts**. Analytics-driven alerting and anomaly detection. Takes historical data and makes predictions. It will suppress false positives.
* **Splunk-to-Sumo conversion migration tool**.
* **Ask Sumo tool**.
* Behavior insights (LogReduce, etc.)

## Observability

### Alerts

Use our *Anomaly detection method* when you create a monitor. This method applies machine learning techniques to detect anomalies and identify suspicious patterns. It establishes baselines for normal behavior so you receive alerts when deviations or unusual activities are encountered.
